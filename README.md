Evernote Rust SDK generator
==========

Playground/experiment in creating some sort of autogenerated Evernote Cloud API SDK for Rust

## What's this

This repository is currently just a playground for me as of now, I want to try implementing something like [QEverCloudGenerator](https://github.com/d1vanov/QEverCloudGenerator) but generating Rust source code which would implement the functionality of Evernote SDK. The idea is to take [Evernote Thrift IDL files](https://github.com/evernote/evernote-thrift), parse them into an AST with [thrift-parser](https://github.com/ihciah/thrift-parser) and then generate Rust code which conveniently hides inside itself all the complexity of communicating with Evernote via Thrift protocol.

It's just a side hustle experiment for me now, don't expect any kind of production readiness any time soon. Or at all.
